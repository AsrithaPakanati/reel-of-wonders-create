# Welcome to our project

## Project info

Problem Statement:
Traditional storytelling often lacks the interactivity and visual appeal needed to engage modern children. With short attention spans and a preference for immersive content, there’s a need for a creative, educational, and personalized storytelling experience.

We propose an AI-powered platform where children can generate animated story reels by selecting a theme, visual style, and prompt. The platform uses GenAI to bring stories to life with visuals, narration, and a personal story library — making storytelling fun, interactive, and inspiring.
